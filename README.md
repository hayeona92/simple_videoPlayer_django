### choice of lanaguage: python(Django)


When it comes to choosing which tech to use, it would be ideal if a developer has deep insight on all aspects of each tech so that one could achieve both maximum efficiency and productivity.

However, since I had only experience in Node.js for server-side lanaguge, the choice of lanauge was limited to Node.js and Django.

the reason for me to choose Django instead of Node.js is I thought there is no need of asynchronous work for the task, and only operation needed is CRUD.

Besides, I thought it would be worthwhile for me to taste how django performs too.

### choice of Web Server: Nginx

Simply put, I was not confident in handling web server that I never expereinced and this was the reason to choose Nginx.
